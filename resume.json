Jeff excelled at all 3 tasks and not only that, was very methodical on how he worked through each step of each individual task. We will put his code into production in a few weeks. The code Jeff worked on will not only save us money (he worked on integrating a Payment Processor into our checkout flow), but will also allow us to drive further engagement with our products (he worked on integrating an email gateway with custom triggers to send individualized emails and custom reports on Google Analytics). I wish Jeff the very best."
